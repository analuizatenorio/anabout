I am a math PhD student at the University of São Paulo under the supervision of Prof Hugo Luiz Mariano. I have completed my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Pure Mathematics at the University of São Paulo.

In my Scientific initiation, I was introduced to Category Theory and the basic concepts of Algebraic Geometry to study Algebraic Geometry of <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=C^{\infty}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C^{\infty}" title="C^{\infty}" /></a>-rings, which lead me to study, during my Master Degree, Cohomology of Grothendieck toposes. 

Currently, I am generalizing the notion of a Grothendieck (pre)topology to develop an expanded Sheaf Cohomology Theory and investigate its applications.
